Cloudflare offers a globally distributed content delivery network with DNS. Technically, the information transfer between your browser and our website is routed through Cloudflare's network. This enables Cloudflare to analyze traffic between your browser and our website and to act as a filter between our servers and potentially malicious internet traffic. Cloudflare may also use cookies or other technologies to recognize internet users, which are used solely for the purpose described here.

### General Information and Mandatory Information

#### Data Protection

The operators of these pages take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We treat your personal data confidentially and in accordance with the statutory data protection regulations and this privacy policy.

When you use this website, various personal data are collected. Personal data are data with which you can be personally identified. This privacy policy explains what data we collect and what we use it for. It also explains how and for what purpose this happens.

We would like to point out that data transmission over the Internet (e.g., when communicating by email) can have security gaps. A complete protection of data against access by third parties is not possible.

#### Notice on the Responsible Entity
The responsible entity for data processing on this website is:

Aron Homberg<br />
August-Horch-Str. 16<br />
80999 MÃ¼nchen<br />
<br />
Email: privacy-policy@RedakTool.ai

The responsible entity is the natural or legal person who alone or jointly with others decides on the purposes and means of processing personal data (e.g., names, email addresses, etc.).

#### Storage Duration
Unless a more specific storage period has been mentioned within this privacy policy, your personal data will remain with us until the purpose for data processing no longer applies. If you make a legitimate request for deletion or revoke your consent to data processing, your data will be deleted unless we have other legally permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g., tax or commercial law retention periods); in the latter case, the deletion will take place after these reasons cease to apply.

#### Note on Data Transfer to the USA
Our website includes tools from companies based in the USA. When these tools are active, your personal data may be transferred to the US servers of the respective companies. We would like to point out that the USA is not a safe third country in the sense of EU data protection law. US companies are obliged to hand over personal data to security authorities without you as a data subject being able to take legal action against this. Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that US authorities (e.g., intelligence services) process, evaluate and permanently store your data on US servers for monitoring purposes. We have no influence over these processing activities.

#### Revocation of Your Consent to Data Processing
Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You can revoke an already given consent at any time. The legality of the data processing carried out until the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.

#### Right to Object to Data Collection in Special Cases and to Direct Advertising (Art. 21 GDPR)

IF DATA PROCESSING IS BASED ON ART. 6 PARA. 1 LIT. E OR F GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT AT ANY TIME TO OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA FOR REASONS ARISING FROM YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL BASIS ON WHICH PROCESSING IS BASED CAN BE FOUND IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU OBJECT, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA UNLESS WE CAN PROVE COMPELLING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING WHICH OVERRIDE YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS, AND FREEDOMS, OR IF THE PROCESSING IS FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT, EXERCISE OR DEFENSE OF LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION UNDER ART. 21 PARA. 1 GDPR).

IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS PROCESSED TO CONDUCT DIRECT ADVERTISING, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY TIME TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA CONCERNING YOU FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUCH ADVERTISING; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING, INSOFAR AS IT IS RELATED TO SUCH DIRECT ADVERTISING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL SUBSEQUENTLY NO LONGER BE USED FOR THE PURPOSE OF DIRECT ADVERTISING (OBJECTION UNDER ART. 21 PARA. 2 GDPR).

#### Complaint to the Competent Supervisory Authority
In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects have a right of complaint to a supervisory authority, particularly in the member state of their habitual residence, their place of work or the place of the alleged violation. The right of complaint is without prejudice to other administrative or judicial remedies.

#### Right to Data Portability
You have the right to have data that we process based on your consent or in fulfillment of a contract automatically delivered to yourself or to a third party in a standard, machine-readable format. If you request the direct transfer of data to another responsible party, this will only be done to the extent it is technically feasible.

#### SSL or TLS Encryption
For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as orders or inquiries you send to us as the site operator, this site uses an SSL or TLS encryption. You can recognize an encrypted connection in your browser's address line when it changes from "http://" to "https://" and the lock icon is displayed in your browser's address bar.

If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.

#### Information, Deletion, and Correction
You have the right at any time within the framework of applicable legal provisions to free information about your stored personal data, its origin and recipients, and the purpose of data processing, and possibly a right to correction or deletion of this data. For this purpose and for further questions on the subject of personal data, you can always contact us.

#### Right to Restriction of Processing
You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. You can contact us at any time for this purpose. The right to restriction of processing exists in the following cases:

- If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored with us, we usually need time to verify this. For the duration of the examination, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.
- If the processing of your personal data has happened/is happening unlawfully, you can request the restriction of data processing instead of deletion.
- If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it for the exercise, defense, or assertion of legal claims, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of deletion.
- If you have lodged an objection pursuant to Art. 21 Sect. 1 GDPR, a balance must be struck between your interests and ours. As long as it has not been determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.
- If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, these data â apart from their storage â may only be processed with your consent or for the assertion, exercise, or defense of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest of the European Union or a Member State.

Our website and mobile web service use the "Scalable Central Measurement Method" (SZM) of Kantar Germany GmbH for determining statistical parameters to estimate the likelihood of text duplication. This involves the collection of anonymous measurement data.
