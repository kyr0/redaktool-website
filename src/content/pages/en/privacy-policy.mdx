Cloudflare offers a globally distributed content delivery network with DNS. Technically, the information transfer between your browser and our website is routed through Cloudflare's network. This enables Cloudflare to analyze traffic between your browser and our website and to act as a filter between our servers and potentially malicious internet traffic. Cloudflare may also use cookies or other technologies to recognize internet users, which are used solely for the purpose described here.

### General Information and Mandatory Information

#### Data Protection

The operators of these pages take the protection of your personal data very seriously. We treat your personal data confidentially and in accordance with the statutory data protection regulations and this privacy policy.

When you use this website, various personal data are collected. Personal data are data with which you can be personally identified. This privacy policy explains what data we collect and what we use it for. It also explains how and for what purpose this happens.

We would like to point out that data transmission over the Internet (e.g., when communicating by email) can have security gaps. A complete protection of data against access by third parties is not possible.

#### Notice on the Responsible Entity
The responsible entity for data processing on this website is:

Aron Homberg<br />
August-Horch-Str. 16<br />
80999 München<br />
<br />
Email: privacy-policy@RedakTool.ai

The responsible entity is the natural or legal person who alone or jointly with others decides on the purposes and means of processing personal data (e.g., names, email addresses, etc.).

#### Storage Duration
Unless a more specific storage period has been mentioned within this privacy policy, your personal data will remain with us until the purpose for data processing no longer applies. If you make a legitimate request for deletion or revoke your consent to data processing, your data will be deleted unless we have other legally permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g., tax or commercial law retention periods); in the latter case, the deletion will take place after these reasons cease to apply.

#### Note on Data Transfer to the USA
Our website includes tools from companies based in the USA. When these tools are active, your personal data may be transferred to the US servers of the respective companies. We would like to point out that the USA is not a safe third country in the sense of EU data protection law. US companies are obliged to hand over personal data to security authorities without you as a data subject being able to take legal action against this. Therefore, it cannot be ruled out that US authorities (e.g., intelligence services) process, evaluate and permanently store your data on US servers for monitoring purposes. We have no influence over these processing activities.

#### Revocation of Your Consent to Data Processing
Many data processing operations are only possible with your express consent. You can revoke an already given consent at any time. The legality of the data processing carried out until the revocation remains unaffected by the revocation.

#### Right to Object to Data Collection in Special Cases and to Direct Advertising (Art. 21 GDPR)

IF DATA PROCESSING IS BASED ON ART. 6 PARA. 1 LIT. E OR F GDPR, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT AT ANY TIME TO OBJECT TO THE PROCESSING OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA FOR REASONS ARISING FROM YOUR PARTICULAR SITUATION; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING BASED ON THESE PROVISIONS. THE RESPECTIVE LEGAL BASIS ON WHICH PROCESSING IS BASED CAN BE FOUND IN THIS PRIVACY POLICY. IF YOU OBJECT, WE WILL NO LONGER PROCESS YOUR AFFECTED PERSONAL DATA UNLESS WE CAN PROVE COMPELLING LEGITIMATE GROUNDS FOR THE PROCESSING WHICH OVERRIDE YOUR INTERESTS, RIGHTS, AND FREEDOMS, OR IF THE PROCESSING IS FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT, EXERCISE OR DEFENSE OF LEGAL CLAIMS (OBJECTION UNDER ART. 21 PARA. 1 GDPR).

IF YOUR PERSONAL DATA IS PROCESSED TO CONDUCT DIRECT ADVERTISING, YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OBJECT AT ANY TIME TO THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA CONCERNING YOU FOR THE PURPOSE OF SUCH ADVERTISING; THIS ALSO APPLIES TO PROFILING, INSOFAR AS IT IS RELATED TO SUCH DIRECT ADVERTISING. IF YOU OBJECT, YOUR PERSONAL DATA WILL SUBSEQUENTLY NO LONGER BE USED FOR THE PURPOSE OF DIRECT ADVERTISING (OBJECTION UNDER ART. 21 PARA. 2 GDPR).

#### Complaint to the Competent Supervisory Authority
In the event of violations of the GDPR, data subjects have a right of complaint to a supervisory authority, particularly in the member state of their habitual residence, their place of work or the place of the alleged violation. The right of complaint is without prejudice to other administrative or judicial remedies.

#### Right to Data Portability
You have the right to have data that we process based on your consent or in fulfillment of a contract automatically delivered to yourself or to a third party in a standard, machine-readable format. If you request the direct transfer of data to another responsible party, this will only be done to the extent it is technically feasible.

#### SSL or TLS Encryption
For security reasons and to protect the transmission of confidential content, such as orders or inquiries you send to us as the site operator, this site uses an SSL or TLS encryption. You can recognize an encrypted connection in your browser's address line when it changes from "http://" to "https://" and the lock icon is displayed in your browser's address bar.

If SSL or TLS encryption is activated, the data you transmit to us cannot be read by third parties.

#### Information, Deletion, and Correction
You have the right at any time within the framework of applicable legal provisions to free information about your stored personal data, its origin and recipients, and the purpose of data processing, and possibly a right to correction or deletion of this data. For this purpose and for further questions on the subject of personal data, you can always contact us.

#### Right to Restriction of Processing
You have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data. You can contact us at any time for this purpose. The right to restriction of processing exists in the following cases:

- If you dispute the accuracy of your personal data stored with us, we usually need time to verify this. For the duration of the examination, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.
- If the processing of your personal data has happened/is happening unlawfully, you can request the restriction of data processing instead of deletion.
- If we no longer need your personal data, but you need it for the exercise, defense, or assertion of legal claims, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data instead of deletion.
- If you have lodged an objection pursuant to Art. 21 Sect. 1 GDPR, a balance must be struck between your interests and ours. As long as it has not been determined whose interests prevail, you have the right to request the restriction of the processing of your personal data.
- If you have restricted the processing of your personal data, these data – apart from their storage – may only be processed with your consent or for the assertion, exercise, or defense of legal claims or for the protection of the rights of another natural or legal person or for reasons of important public interest of the European Union or a Member State.

#### Objection to Advertising Emails
The use of contact data published within the framework of the imprint obligation for the transmission of advertising and information materials not expressly requested is hereby objected to. The operators of the pages expressly reserve the right to take legal action in the event of unsolicited sending of advertising information, such as spam emails.

They are either stored temporarily for the duration of a session (session cookies) or permanently (permanent cookies) on your device. Session cookies are automatically deleted at the end of your visit. Permanent cookies remain stored on your device until you delete them yourself or an automatic deletion is performed by your web browser.

Cookies, which are necessary for the execution of the electronic communication process (necessary cookies) or for the provision of certain functions you desire (functional cookies, e.g., for the shopping cart function) or to optimize the website (e.g., cookies for measuring the web audience), are stored on the basis of Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. f GDPR, unless another legal basis is specified. The website operator has a legitimate interest in storing cookies for the technically error-free and optimized provision of its services. If a consent to storing cookies has been requested, the respective cookies are stored exclusively based on this consent (Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. a GDPR); this consent can be revoked at any time.

You can set your browser to inform you about the setting of cookies and allow cookies only in individual cases, exclude the acceptance of cookies for specific cases or in general, and activate the automatic deletion of cookies when closing the browser. If cookies are deactivated, the functionality of this website may be limited.

Insofar as cookies are used by third-party companies or for analysis purposes, we will inform you separately within the framework of this privacy policy and, if necessary, ask for consent.

A merging of this data with other data sources is not carried out.

The collection of this data is based on Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. f GDPR. The website operator has a legitimate interest in the technically error-free presentation and optimization of his website – for this purpose, the server log files must be recorded.

If you send us inquiries via the contact form, your details from the inquiry form, including the contact data you provided there, will be stored for the purpose of processing the inquiry and in case of follow-up questions. We do not share this data without your consent.

The processing of this data is based on Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. b GDPR, if your request is related to the fulfillment of a contract or is necessary for the implementation of pre-contractual measures. In all other cases, the processing is based on our legitimate interest in the effective processing of requests addressed to us (Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. f GDPR) or on your consent (Art. 6 Sect. 1 lit. a GDPR) if this has been requested.

The data you enter in the contact form will remain with us until you request us to delete it, revoke your consent for storage, or the purpose for data storage lapses (e.g., after the completion of processing your inquiry). Mandatory statutory provisions – in particular retention periods – remain unaffected.

#### Cookies and Access Number Notifications

Our website and mobile web service use the "Scalable Central Measurement Method" (SZM) of Kantar Germany GmbH for determining statistical parameters to estimate the likelihood of text duplication. This involves the collection of anonymous measurement data.

This method was developed with data protection in mind. Its sole purpose is to determine the likelihood of individual texts being duplicated. This allows our authors to participate in the distributions of VG Wort, which ensure the legal remuneration for the use of copyright-protected works according to § 53 UrhG. The measurement is carried out with a legitimate interest under Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR.

At no point are individual users identified. Your identity always remains protected. You will not receive any advertising through the system.

If you do not wish to participate in the measurement, you can object at the following link: optout.ioam.de
